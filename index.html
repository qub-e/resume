    <h3 class="subcat">Profile</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a student currently studying at Mesa Community College for an
      Associates in Computer Science. While studying Computer Science provides
      me with some experience, I feel myself yearning for more oppurtunity to
      grow my skillset. Working with a team and learning the ropes can help me
      obtain the knowledge that can't be gained from just studying.
      <br><br>
      Some hobbies that I enjoy doing are playing piano and modifying video games!
